# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project Overview
Bag-It! is an online fashion platform that allows users to browse a vast catalog of clothing through search functions. 
Users can add items to a virtual bag, which can be shared with other users or displayed on their profile.
It offers a diverse range of clothing categories to suit all styles.
To keep up with trends, users can view the most bagged items to see what's baggin' and to inspire their own bags.
Users can also randomize their bags with a single click.
Bag-It! aims to be an accessible and intuitive tool for people who want to put together virtual outfits.
